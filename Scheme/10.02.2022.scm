Consider the following code:
(define (r x y . s)
 (set! s (if (cons? s) (car s) 1))
 (lambda ()
 (if (< x y)
 (let ((z x))
 (set! x (+ s x))
 z)
 y)))
1. What can we use r for? Describe how it works and give some useful examples of its usage.
2. It makes sense to create a version of r without the y parameter? If the answer is yes, implement
such version; if no, explain why.
