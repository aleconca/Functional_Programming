;1) Define a procedure which takes a natural number n and a default value, and creates a n by n matrix
;filled with the default value, implemented through vectors (i.e. a vector of vectors).


(define (helper vect i n def)
  
  (if (< i n)
      ((vector-set! vect i def)
      (helper vect (+ i 1) n def))
      ;else
      vect
      )
  )

;input: n, def 
;output: nxn matrix filled with def
;hint: use vectors
(define (def-sq-matrix n def)
  
  (let loop ((i 0) (vect (make-vector n)))
           (vector-set! vect i (helper (make-vector n) 0 n def))
           (when (< i n)
               ( loop (+ i 1) ))
    )
  
   )


;2) Let S = {0, 1, ..., n-1} x {0, 1, ..., n-1} for a natural number n. Consider a n by n matrix M, stored in a
;vector of vectors, containing pairs (x,y) âˆˆ S, as a function from S to S (e.g. f(2,3) = (1,0) is represented
;by M[2][3] = (1,0)). Define a procedure to check if M defines a bijection (i.e. a function that is both
