;1) Define a procedure which takes a natural number n and a default value, and creates a n by n matrix
;filled with the default value, implemented through vectors (i.e. a vector of vectors).


;input: n, def 
;output: nxn matrix filled with def
;hint: use vectors
(define (def-sq-matrix n def)
  
  (let loop ((i 0) (vect (make-vector n)))
    (when (< i n)
       (vector-set! vect i (make-vector n def))
       ( loop (+ i 1) vect ))
    vect
    )
  
   )

   

;(make-vector size [v]) 
;Returns a mutable vector with size slots, where all slots are initialized to contain v.
;Note that v is shared for all elements, so for mutable data, mutating an element will affect other elements.

;2) Let S = {0, 1, ..., n-1} x {0, 1, ..., n-1} for a natural number n. Consider a n by n matrix M, stored in a
;vector of vectors, containing pairs (x,y) âˆˆ S, as a function from S to S (e.g. f(2,3) = (1,0) is represented
;by M[2][3] = (1,0)). Define a procedure to check if M defines a bijection (i.e. a function that is both injective and surjective)
