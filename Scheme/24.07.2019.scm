#lang racket

;Write a functional, tail recursive implementation of a procedure that takes a list of numbers L and two values
;x and y, and returns three lists: one containing all the elements that are less than both x and y, the second one
;containing all the elements in the range [x,y], the third one with all the elements bigger than both x and y. It
;is not possible to use the named let construct in the implementation.
