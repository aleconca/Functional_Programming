;Define a defun construct like in Common Lisp, where (defun f (x1 x2 ...) body) is used for defining a
;function f with parameters x1 x2 ....

;Every function defined in this way should also be able to return a value x by calling (ret x).


(define ret-store '())

(define (ret v) 
  ((car ret-store) v));why not an apply? Apply is used when you want to apply a procedure to a list of arguments

;define contruct
(define-syntax defun
  (syntax-rules ()
    ;define pattern to match
    ((_ fname (var ...) body ...)
     ;define behaviour, perch√® no begin?
     (define (fname var ...)
       (let ((out ;CONTEXT up--------------------------------------
                  (call/cc (lambda (c)
                             (set! ret-store (cons c ret-store))
                             body ...)) ;ret is called in the body
                   ));down------------------------------------------
         ;(set! ret-store (cdr ret-store))
         out)))))


; Use the defun macro to define a function
(defun my-function (x)
  (+ x 1)
  (ret 10)
)

(my-function 5) ;prints 10

;when we save the continuation, we are saving the context, i.e. the definition of the function, the variable out containig 
;the evaluation of the body and the set!.

;If we will decide to call (ret x), then we will resume computation from the saved context. What we will obtain is 
;an evaluation of the body in any case as the out variable contains it, despite the fact that we are discarding the car of ret-store.

;ret-store is called like this because we are indeed saving return values.

;N.B. by puttng body in the lambda we are evaluating it already.

;no begin here:
;In Scheme, the begin form is used to sequence multiple expressions and return the value of the last one. It's not needed in all situations.
;In the case of the defun macro you provided, it's not necessary to use begin because we are defining a procedure using let to bind the result of the expressions, 
;and we are not looking for a value to return within a sequence of expressions.
