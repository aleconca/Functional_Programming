#lang racket

;Consider the Foldable and Applicative type classes in Haskell. We want to implement something
;analogous in Scheme for vectors. Note: you can use the following library functions in your code: vectormap, vector-append.
;1) Define vector-foldl and vector-foldr.
;2) Define vector-pure and vector-<*>.
