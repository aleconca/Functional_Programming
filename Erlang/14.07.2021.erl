%Consider a main process which takes two lists: one of function names, and one of lists of parameters (the
%first element of with contains the parameters for the first function, and so forth). For each function, the
%main process must spawn a worker process, passing to it the corresponding argument list. If one of the
%workers fails for some reason, the main process must create another worker running the same function.
%The main process ends when all the workers are done.
