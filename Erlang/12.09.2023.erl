%Consider the infinite list of binary trees of Exercise 2: instead of infinite lists, we want to create processes which
%return the current element of the "virtual infinite list" with the message next, and terminate with the message stop.
%1. Define a function btrees to create a process corresponding to the infinite tree of Exercise 2.1.
%2. Define a function incbtrees to create a process corresponding to the infinite tree of Exercise 2.2.
%Notes: for security reasons, processes must only answer to their creating process; to define trees, you can use
%suitable tuples with atoms as customary in Erlang (e.g. {branch, {leaf, 1}, {leaf, 1}}).
