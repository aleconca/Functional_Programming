{-
Consider a data structure Gtree for general trees, i.e. trees containg some data in each node, and a
variable number of children.
1. Define the Gtree data structure.
2. Define gtree2list, i.e. a function which translates a Gtree to a list.
3. Make Gtree an instance of Functor, Foldable, and Applicative.
