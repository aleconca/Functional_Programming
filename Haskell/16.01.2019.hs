{-We want to define a data structure, called Listree, to define structures working both as lists and as binary
trees, like in the next figure.
1) Define a datatype for Listree.
2) Write the example of the figure with the defined data structure.
3) Make Listree an instance of Functor.
4) Make Listree an instance of Foldable.
5) Make Listree an instance of Applicative.-}
