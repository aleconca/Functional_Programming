>Scheme and Python:

-Scheme and Python are both dynamically typed languages, meaning that you don't need to declare variable types explicitly;

-Both Scheme and Python have a strong focus on simplicity and readability of code, with a preference for clear and concise syntax;

-Scheme, like Python, is an interpreted language, making it easy to experiment with and learn.

>Haskell and C++:

-Haskell and C++ are both statically typed languages, which means you need to declare variable types explicitly;

-C++ is known for its performance and is often used for system-level programming and game development, which is closer to the low-level aspects of programming;

-Haskell, on the other hand, emphasizes functional programming and is known for its type system, which can be quite different from C++'s object-oriented programming paradigm.
